# Credit Card OCR Tesseract Python
This is a hobby project  to develop a tool to read credit cards with Tesseract and simple operations of computer vision. 
`Tesseract` is an optical character recognition engine for various operating systems. It works great and could be trained on a custom dataset. In the case of credit card recognition, we could train `Tesseract` on **OCR-A** font to have a better result. But in this project, I just wanna show the image processing to localize 16 digits and other information such as holder card name, expiration date.... 
### Installation
guide to install `Tesseract` [here](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki)
### Image processing
The souce codes and results can be found in `main.ipynb`
